A comprehensive toolkit that extends Django REST Framework with enhanced functionality and common patterns.

## Overview

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) provide an awesome combination for building REST APIs.

DRF supports many great [plugins](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/community/third-party-packages/) that extend its capabilities even further.

The DRF Toolkit applies common [RESTFul patterns](https://restfulapi.net/) to the framework by adding base classes that can be used in your existing DRF projects.

Most use cases are covered by DRF Toolkit, allowing your project to be simpler so you can focus on the business logic.
